------------------1. INTRO TO REACT APP ------------------

1) npx  --> Node Package Executor

2) npx create-react-app <app-name>   -->  This is the way to create a react app.

3) npm run start  --> It is used to start the app

4) npm run build  --> It is for the deployment of the app in the production. It creates a build folder which includes all the js, css files and many more, this is the folder that is actually served to the user for using not the actuial source folder.


5) Creating a react app thorugh vite
--> 
    (i) npm create vite@latest  --> Using NPM's create utility to create a new vite project that is latest.

    (ii) Choose "react"

    (iii) Choose "JavaScript"

    NOTE: Now you will see that the 01vitereact project does not have the node_modules folder.

    (iv) So you need to move to the project directory and install the npm (npm install) which install all the required modules.


------ 2. Understanding the React flow and structure -----------


(A) 01basicreact

    1) Main Entry point: "01basicreact\src\index.js"


    2) Understanding "01basicreact\src\index.js":


    React and ReactDOM   -->  2 libraries that are being imported to manipulate the DOM of Web 

    React -> Core Foundational Library
    ReactDOM -> This is the implemention of React on Web

    NOTE: React creats its own DOM known as "Virtual DOM"


    Refer to the files itself for better understanding

    3) If you notice that there is no js file injected in 01basicreact\public\index.html but still it is rendering with the help of index.js  --->  "react-scripts": "5.0.1" from 01basicreact\package.json does this all


(B) 02vitereact

    1) .jsx file allows you to send a single element. So better use fragment 
    <>
    // More elements inside fragment enclosure
    </>

    2) the function name in .jsx file should always start with a caps letter (strict rule otherwise error)

    3) Created a myfile.jsx which will render another html which is exported to App.jsx inside the App()

    NOTE: Doing the same for 01basicreact

NOTE: For any case either react app through vite or not you should start the name of the react components with caps letter. Do it with the folder name also (good/ideal practice)
